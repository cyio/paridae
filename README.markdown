# Make Twitter Responsive

I'm not a fan of Twitter for Mac and I use Windows 8 hours a day at
work, so I needed something a little more lightweight than the
twitter.com webapp.

This chrome extension makes twitter fit to your browser window when it's
less than the default width.

It also opens links in a new tab on the "largest" Google Chrome window
you have open.

## Installation

I haven't dropped this in the Chrome store because I'm not that
proud of it yet. So, for those that don't know how to load an unpacked
extension:

  1. Clone this repo
  2. Go to Extensions in Google Chrome settings
  3. Check **Developer Mode** in the top right corner
  4. Click **Load unpacked extension**
  5. Select the path of the extension files
