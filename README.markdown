# Make Twitter Responsive

![promo](http://f.cl.ly/items/3b012S1K060E3I3V3K0j/responsive-twitter-440.png)

## Features

* Shrinks twitter.com to fit in almost any width you give it.
* Disables jQuery animations so that it will feel quicker.
* Provides a browser icon/button to open twitter.com in a chrome-less
  window (i.e. no toolbars) and will remember the window size/position
  upon closing.
* Opens clicked links in the background.
* Open links with keyboard shortcut `o`.
* Removes hover effects when the window is really small. Favors keyboard
  shortcuts over mouse interaction.
* If you use the [Embedly extension][1], it hides the metadata output by
  Embedly.
