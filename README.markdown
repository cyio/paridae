# Make Twitter Responsive

I'm not a fan of Twitter for Mac and I use Windows 8 hours a day at
work, so I needed something a little more lightweight than the
twitter.com webapp.

This chrome extension makes twitter fit to your browser window when it's
less than the default width.

It also opens links in a new tab on the "largest" Google Chrome window
you have open.
